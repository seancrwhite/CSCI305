	<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
	<h3>What is the next concept that you would like to learn about your text editor?</h3>
	<p>I've been using Sublime Text 2 for almost 4 years now, so I'm hoping to finally start learning the differences with Sublime Text 3 now that it's been out for a while.</p>
	<h3>What about your VCS?</h3>
	<p>I would like more experience managing different branches of my code.</p>
	<h3>How many commits did you make while working on this project?</h3>
	<p>One.</p>
	<h3>How would you structure your commits differently next time?</h3>
	<p>It depends on the size of the project. Generally, for something this small one commit seems appropriate to me, but something bigger will be spread out.</p>
